## `BRIDGEPORT`
BRIDGEPORT is a publicly accessible web portal that provides massive analytic resources. MuSIC is a multi-scale atlas that parcellates the human brain by structural covariance in MRI data over the lifespan and a wide range of disease populations. BRIDGEPORT allows you to interactively browse the atlas in a 3D view and explore the phenotypic landscape and genetic architecture of the human brain. This web portal aims to foster multidisciplinary crosstalk across neuroimaging, machine learning, and genetic communities.
